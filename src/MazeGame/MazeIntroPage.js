      <p>
        In the deep shadows of Middle-earth, the Rings of Power have been
        scattered throughout the ruins of Khazad-d√ªm. You, a lone Elf of
        Rivendell, must brave the twisting halls, gather at least three lost rings,
        and find the Doors of Moria.
      </p>

      <p>
        But beware... The door will not open for strength of arms, nor by the
        light of day. You must speak the secret, the Elvish word known only to
        those who walk in wisdom. Fail, and you shall not pass. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
      </p>
      <p>
        The ruins can only be braved in darkness. Choose a member of your
        fellowship. They will be blindfolded - guided only by the voices of their
        friends (you cannot touch them).

        From this moment forth, the following words cannot be spoken: "up, down,
        left, right, north, south, east, west, forwards or backwards" in any
        tongue. If they are there will be a 30 second penalty for each word.
